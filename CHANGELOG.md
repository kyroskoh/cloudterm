[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions align
with [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/BradPerbs/cloudterm/releases).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `npm test` on every pull
  request and on pushes to `main`.
- CI runs `npm audit --omit=dev` to block high-severity vulnerabilities in
  production dependencies.
- Optional Authenticode / macOS code signing in release builds when
  `WIN_CSC_LINK` / `CSC_LINK` repository secrets are configured (certificate
  **pending procurement** — builds stay unsigned until secrets are added). See
  [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).
- [Security documentation](docs/security.md): VirusTotal/SmartScreen, signing,
  dependency audit, vulnerability reporting.
- First-run assistant warning explaining that tools act on live sessions and
  what each approval mode means.
- Confirm dialog before switching the assistant to **Never ask**.
- Contributor docs: [assistant approval modes](docs/assistant-approvals.md),
  [RDP credential lifetime](docs/rdp-credentials.md), and
  [IME composition plan](docs/ime-composition.md).

### Changed

- npm production and dev dependencies updated (`npm audit fix`); esbuild
  overridden to a patched release for the dev toolchain.
- Default assistant approval mode is **Ask before changes** (`writes`): reads
  run freely; mutating tools stop for approval.
- New installs ship with `allowLocalTools: false`.
- RDP passwords are cleared from the renderer as soon as CredSSP completes;
  reconnect always re-fetches credentials from the vault. See
  [RDP credentials](docs/rdp-credentials.md).
- Activity log redacts `rdpPassword` and `bmcPassword` in change diffs.

### Fixed

- Session log transcript files use a unique exclusive path per session so two
  tabs in the same second cannot interleave into one file.
- First-run approval warning only clears after **Got it** (not Escape / backdrop).
- Assistant approval acknowledgement accepts only real booleans when loading
  `assistant.json`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Host monitoring with desktop notifications when a saved host stops answering.
- Launch CloudTerm at sign-in (Windows).
- Check for updates on every launch.
- BMC/IPMI web UI opens in a tab with auto-login.
- App icon on every platform (`build/icon.png`).

### Changed

- Host cards fit every protocol kind on one row.
- Distro icons halved to match on-screen draw size.
- Renderer dependencies kept out of the packaged app bundle.
- Monitor events kept out of the notifications bell.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Quick connect: type an address in the host picker and connect immediately.
- Windows install and update via `winget install CloudBlast.CloudTerm`. See
  [docs/winget.md](docs/winget.md).
