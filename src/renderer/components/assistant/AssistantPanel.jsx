 * pane: a conversation about a server usually turns into a conversation about
 * the one next to it, and a per-pane panel would mean starting again.
 *
 * It is built as its own card, the way `#main-content` is, with the shell's
 * gutter between the two rather than a border against it. Butting a flat
 * panel up against a rounded card leaves a sliver of background trapped in the
 * corner, which is the one arrangement that looks like a mistake rather than a
 * choice.
 *
 * Everything inside is laid out on one spacing step, and the transcript owns
 * the rhythm through a single `space-y` rather than each kind of item carrying
 * its own margins. That is what stops a run of tool calls and replies from
 * drifting into uneven bands.

                The input takes the whole width and its controls sit on a
                row underneath, rather than crowding into the line being
                typed on. That is what lets the model chip carry a real
                label instead of an icon, and it keeps a long question from
                squeezing the buttons.

                No rule above it, and no surface of its own: the outline is
                what says "type here", and a divider as well would cut the
                card in two for no gain. Transparent rather than a colour
                matching the card, because the card is translucent and
                painting the same wash twice makes a pale rectangle of the
                one part of the panel that should sit flat.

                Focus lifts the border's colour and nothing else, as every
                other input in the app does. A ring would add two pixels
                outside the box and nudge the whole composer as you click
                into it. */}

/**
 * One element that changes width, not two swapped for each other: a swap has
 * nothing to animate between, and the rail is the same column with everything
 * but the button clipped off. That is how the sidebar opens on the other side
 * of the window, and this is the same motion mirrored and shortened.
 *
 * The card keeps its full width the whole way and the column clips it, rather
 * than the card being squeezed and stretched. Reflowing a transcript, a
 * markdown block and a growing textarea on every frame of a 180ms slide is
 * both expensive and ugly: the text rewraps four times on the way in. Clipped,
 * the panel is laid out once and then revealed.
 *
 * It is pinned to the right edge for the same reason the sidebar's items are
 * pinned to the left: whatever is already on screen should stay where it is
 * while the rest arrives beside it.
