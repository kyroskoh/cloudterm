/**
 * A tool call stopped in front of the user.
 *
 * The safety story of this whole feature rests on this card, so it shows the
 * thing that is about to happen verbatim rather than a description of it. For
 * a command that means the command exactly as it will be sent, in the terminal
 * font, wrapped rather than truncated: an approval you cannot read to the end
 * of is not an approval.
 *
 * The host is named for the same reason. "Run this?" is a different question
 * depending on whether the answer runs on a staging box or on the machine the
 * business is sitting on, and the panel is often pointed somewhere other than
 * the tab in front.
 *
 * There is one card, not two. The transcript already had a row for the call
 * itself, so a question about that call arriving as a second card said the
 * same command twice and left the user comparing them to check they were the
 * same thing. The question lands on the row that is already there, and the
 * row goes back to reporting the call once it is answered. See the
 * `approval-request` case in `useAssistant`.
 *
 * No colour wash. This was a yellow box with yellow text on it, which reads as
 * an error rather than a question and, worse, tinted the command itself: the
 * one string on the card that has to be read exactly was the hardest thing on
 * it to read. The card is neutral and simply sits above the tool rows around
 * it, lifted by a ring and a shadow rather than by hue, and the amber is spent
 * on the 6px dot, which is what the transcript already uses to mean "waiting".
 * The shape is the tool row's: a 32px header line with a dot, a title and the
 * host, so answering it collapses the card onto the line it already had.
 *
 * The answers are a list, one per row, rather than buttons in a line. Three of
 * them do not fit across a 340px panel, and they are not a form's actions:
 * they are the question's answers, so they are drawn the way this panel draws
 * every other set of choices, as menu rows.

/**
 * The rule for every control on this card, in one place.
 *
 * The card fills at `white/[0.06]` over `surface-raised`, which composites to
 * the same lightness as `surface-control`. That is the step the app's menu
 * rows and quiet buttons use for their dark borders and hovers, because they
 * are normally drawn on a panel rather than on a card sitting at that level.
 * Anything here that reaches for the ramp is therefore invisible: a border the
 * colour of the card, and a hover that repaints it in its own colour.
 *
 * So: overlays, which sit a step off whatever they are drawn on, and a border
 * at rest so a row is a thing you can see before you go looking for it. These
 * are `Button`'s `outline` variant, as a full-width row. Keep them in step.
