/**
 * How hard to think, as a dial rather than a list.
 *
 * The five settings are one scale, and a list of five radio rows says
 * otherwise: it makes "low" and "max" look like five different things to
 * choose between rather than two ends of the same run, and it costs five rows
 * of a menu that also has to hold the models. A track says "more of this" in
 * the space of one line, and the stops keep it honest about there being five
 * of them and nothing in between.
 *
 * Built by hand rather than out of `input[type=range]`, which is what this was
 * first, for one reason: every stop has to be able to say its own name before
 * it is picked. A range input is a single hit area, so the labels would have
 * had to be a bubble chasing the pointer along it, and anything laid over the
 * input to catch a hover would have eaten the drag. Here the whole track is
 * one pointer handler and the stops are only hover targets on top of it, so
 * pressing on one still starts a drag: the press reaches the track underneath
 * by bubbling, which is the thing a native input could not offer.
 *
 * That leaves the keyboard and the screen reader to do by hand, which is the
 * block at the bottom: `role="slider"`, the arrows, Home and End.
