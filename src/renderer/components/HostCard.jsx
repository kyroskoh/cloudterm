 * than opening a third one; a card that grows a line for some hosts and not
 * others makes a grid of them look broken. Tags obey that rule too: they sit at
 * the end of the second line, however many of them a host is carrying.
 *
 * Both layouts are the same component because they hold the same things in the
 * same order, and the only real difference is whether that runs across or down.
 *
 * `items` is what this host can be told to do, in `ContextMenu`'s shape, decided
 * by the panel: the same list is behind the button on the card and behind a
 * right-click on it, because they are one question asked two ways.
