 * Which models the assistant offers, and how hard each of them can think.
 *
 * Both of those used to be lists written out by hand, in two files that had to
 * be kept in step with each other and with whatever Anthropic had shipped that
 * month. They were wrong in a way nobody could see: the effort scale offered
 * all five levels for every model, when support for them is per model, so two
 * of the stops quietly did nothing on some of the choices.
 *
 * The installed Claude Code knows both, and says so when asked. The main
 * process asks once its runtime is up and hands the answer to `status()` and
 * to `window.api.ai.onModels`. This file turns that into rows.
 *
 * Nothing here guesses. The question can only be put to a process that is
 * already running, so until the assistant has run once there is exactly one
 * row: whatever Claude Code is already set to use.
