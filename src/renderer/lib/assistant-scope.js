/**
 * What the assistant panel is pointed at.
 *
 * Three modes, and the third is the reason this file exists.
 *
 *   follow    whatever session is in front of the user, and it moves as they
 *             move. A default for tool calls, not a fence: a question about one
 *             server is often answered by looking at the one beside it.
 *
 *   global    every saved host and open session, with nothing ruled out.
 *
 *   targets   an explicit set of sessions and saved hosts, and nothing else.
 *             This one is a fence. The main process refuses tool calls that
 *             name anything outside it, which is the whole point of picking:
 *             "these two boxes" said in the menu is worth more than the same
 *             sentence typed into the chat, where it is only a suggestion.
 *
 * A target may be a session that is open right now or a host that is not
 * connected at all. Both are things you can want the assistant to work on, and
 * the difference between them is whether it has to connect first.
 *
 * The functions here are pure and total: they take a selection and give one
 * back. Nothing in here knows about React, IPC, or how a row is drawn.
