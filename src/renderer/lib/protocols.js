 * record stores in `protocol`. "Desktop" is not one of those: it is a host with
 * no shell at all, which the record has always expressed as
 * `desktop.only`.
 *
 * They are offered together anyway, because "what kind of host is this" is one
 * question to the person answering it. A picker that listed three protocols and
 * left RDP to a section further down the form reads as RDP being missing, which
 * is exactly how it read.
 *
 * So `desktop` is a UI-level kind, resolved back to a stored protocol and a
 * desktop block by the editor. Nothing in the main process knows the word.
