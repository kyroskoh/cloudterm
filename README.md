CloudTerm keeps every way you reach a server in one window. Open an SSH session,
move files over SFTP, forward a port and take a Windows desktop, all on the same
connection and the same tab strip. No second app, no second login.

It connects to anything: your laptop's serial console, a switch that only speaks
telnet, a Windows box over RDP, or a server on any host you like. CloudTerm is
made by [CloudBlast](https://cloudblast.io), a VPS hosting company. It is free for
everyone, and the whole source is here to read and change.

## What is CloudTerm

- **A terminal** for SSH, telnet and serial consoles, with tabs, split panes and
  GPU-accelerated rendering.
- **An SFTP client** on the connection you already have open, with recursive
  transfers and drag and drop.
- **An RDP and VNC viewer**, so a Windows box and a Linux box live side by side
  in the same app.
- **A place to keep servers**: folders, tags, a key vault and snippets, all
  encrypted and all searchable.
- **An AI agent** in a panel beside the terminal, which reads the session you
  are looking at and works on the server through it, asking before it changes
  anything.

<a name="features"></a>
## Features

### AI agent

Pick the agent you already have. CloudTerm drives the CLI on your machine under
your own account, so there is nothing to paste and nothing extra to subscribe
to.

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="230"><img src="docs/logos/claude-code.svg" alt="Claude Code" title="Claude Code" height="32"></td>
    <td align="center" width="230"><img src="docs/logos/codex.svg" alt="Codex" title="Codex" height="32"></td>
    <td align="center" width="230"><img src="docs/logos/opencode.svg" alt="OpenCode" title="OpenCode" height="32"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><b>Claude Code</b></td>
    <td align="center"><b>Codex</b></td>
    <td align="center"><b>OpenCode</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><sub>Anthropic models</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><sub>OpenAI models</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><sub>Any provider you have set up</sub></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><sub>Sign in with <code>claude</code>, then <code>/login</code></sub></td>
    <td align="center"><sub>Sign in with the Codex app or CLI</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><sub>Sign in with <code>opencode auth login</code></sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Whichever you choose, the agent:

- **Reads the session you are watching**, so the error on your screen is the
  one it answers, without you pasting anything
- **Works in the terminal you can see**: commands are typed into the pane and
  the output stays in your scrollback, or run on a hidden channel if you prefer
- **Approval modes control when it asks** — every tool / changes only / never
  (never auto-approves non-blocked tools), plus a first-run warning and a
  confirm step before **Never ask**. See
  [assistant approvals](docs/assistant-approvals.md).
- **Pointed where you like**: the session in front, one you pin, or every host
  you have saved
- **Tools instead of guesses**: connect a saved host, read and write files,
  answer a prompt that is already waiting, read the scrollback
- **Leaves your own machine alone** unless you say otherwise, and stops on its
  own rather than looping
- **Model and reasoning effort per conversation**, with what it is costing, or
  how much of your plan it has used, shown as it works

> Claude Code has to be the native install, the one that puts `claude` in
> `~/.local/bin`. An npm install leaves a `.cmd` shim on Windows, which cannot
> be started the way the agent runs it.

> On Windows, install OpenCode natively with Chocolatey, Scoop, npm, or its
> release binary. A copy installed only inside WSL is not visible to the native
> CloudTerm desktop app.

### Terminal

- **Split panes** in any arrangement, with zoom and fullscreen
- **Tabs** you can name, colour and group, restored on the next launch
- **36 themes**, or pick the colours yourself
- **Find in scrollback** with regex, and clickable links
- **Broadcast input** to every session at once
- **Session recording** and one-click screenshots

### Connections

- **SSH, telnet and serial** in the same window
- **Jump hosts** for anything behind a bastion
- **SOCKS5, SOCKS4 and HTTP proxies**, saved once and used by any connection: terminals, SFTP, port forwards and remote desktops
- **Passwords, keys, SSH agent, certificates** and Windows Hello keys held in the TPM
- **2FA prompts** handled properly
- **Automatic reconnect** after a drop or a laptop waking up
- **Run on connect** commands, replayed every time

### Files and networking

- **Full SFTP manager**: recursive transfers, resume, conflict handling, drag and drop
- **Edit remote files** in your own editor, uploaded on every save
- **Port forwarding**: local, remote and dynamic SOCKS5, with live traffic counters
- **Remote desktops**: RDP and VNC in a pane, tunnelled through SSH

### Organisation

- **Folders and colour-coded tags** across the whole host list
- **Snippets** with prompted values, and packages that run a series of them
- **Instant search** over names, addresses and tags
- **Import** your existing `~/.ssh/config` in one step

### Operating systems

The OS is detected on connect, and the host card and the tab take its logo, so
you can tell a Debian box from a Fedora box at a glance instead of reading
hostnames.

## Screenshots

### Hosts and keychain

Every server in folders, with tags, search and the protocol on the card. Sign in
to CloudBlast and your servers appear here on their own.

<img src="hostscloudterm.png" alt="Hosts and keychain" width="100%">

### Split panes and SFTP

Files on the left, two shells on the right, one connection behind all three.
Split as far as the window allows and drag the dividers where you want them.

<img src="Split%20Pane.png" alt="Split panes and SFTP" width="100%">

### Windows RDP

A full Windows desktop in a tab, next to your Linux sessions. Clipboard works
both ways and the desktop resizes to fit the pane.

<img src="RDP.png" alt="Windows RDP" width="100%">

### Make it yours

Terminal themes, app colours, fonts and even the logo in the title bar.

### Download

Download the latest release for your platform:

| OS | Download |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | [Apple silicon (M1 and later)](https://github.com/BradPerbs/cloudterm/releases/latest/download/CloudTerm-arm64.dmg) · [Intel](https://github.com/BradPerbs/cloudterm/releases/latest/download/CloudTerm-x64.dmg) |
| Windows | [Installer, x64 (recommended)](https://github.com/BradPerbs/cloudterm/releases/latest/download/CloudTerm-Setup-x64.exe) · [Portable, x64](https://github.com/BradPerbs/cloudterm/releases/latest/download/CloudTerm-x64.exe) |
| Linux | [AppImage, x64](https://github.com/BradPerbs/cloudterm/releases/latest/download/CloudTerm-x86_64.AppImage) |

On Windows you can install and update it from a terminal instead:

```powershell
winget install CloudBlast.CloudTerm
```

Or browse [all GitHub releases](https://github.com/BradPerbs/cloudterm/releases).

> **Windows SmartScreen / VirusTotal:** Installers are **unsigned** while a
> code-signing certificate is being procured. This can trigger SmartScreen or
> heuristic scanner warnings (often 1–3 vendors on VirusTotal). See
> [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for details and what to expect after
> signing is enabled.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BradPerbs/cloudterm.git
cd cloudterm
npm install
npm run dev
```

To use the AI agent with OpenCode, install the `opencode` CLI and configure at
least one model provider with `opencode auth login`. CloudTerm uses OpenCode's
existing providers and credentials; it does not copy or store them.

Build a portable executable into `dist/`:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the unit test suite before opening a pull request:

```bash
npm test
```

The same suite runs on every pull request via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
